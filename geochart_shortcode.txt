Integrates Google\'s Geochart Region visualization as a configurable shortcode. 

== Description ==
Integrates the Geochart Region visualization from Google as a configurable shortcode for WordPress. More info on the visualization here: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart
Having the integration as a shortcode allows a user to place a shortcode into a page without additional coding. Regionlist, height, width, color and secondary label are configurable on the shortcode, so you can use it in multiple places on a blog easily.

The Geochart visualization is intended to associate data with a map of highlighted regions. Read the link above for more detail on how the Google visualization works. This is simply an integration for a WordPress site. You are still bound by all of Google\'s privacy policies and terms and conditions.
